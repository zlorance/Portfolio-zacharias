With my 5+ years experience in blockchain, I have acquired a dual career skillset as both a technical writer and blockchain analyst. 
During my professional tenure in the blockchain economy, I have:

**1.** Covered several blue chip crypto projects for institutional investors

**2.** Successfully launched my own startup

**3.** Worked on both the on-chain metaverse and DeFi.
